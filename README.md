# CV-marker-terrain-generator
This project uses a grid of CV markers to make an intuitive user interface to allow collaboration within terrain creation.



To run the program, download both the processing and the Blender file.
After turning on the marker.py file belonging to DUEIT, you need to run the processing file.
Lastly, before running the Blender, you need a library which can be found here: https://github.com/maybites/NodeOSC
after turning on the OSC connection on Blender, everything will work automatically
